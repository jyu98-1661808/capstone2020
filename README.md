# Mathagotchi

Mathagotchi is an android application dedicated in helping 1st graders overcome their numeracy difficulties with embedded conservational and environmental values.  
From basic addition to subtraction, the application utilizes game-based learning through a focus on saving endangered animals. 
Each endangered species (5 in total) represents a topic in the math curricula; users must solve a variety of math problems pertaining to that topic in order to clean up the animal's terrible environment.
